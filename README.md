# DEandPSO
Developed Python programs to implement Differential Evolution (DE) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) techniques for solving single-objective optimization problems. Applied DE and PSO to Eggholder and Holder Table functions, achieving convergence trends through systematic experimentation.
